    This is interesting, it has helped a little in what i ought to expect in class.  Theres still a few holes I need to fill in on this subject that will be taken care of by further research and continuation of the class.

    This is a subreddit I follow.  I am fascinated with how people are able to represent datasets.  This is something I would like to learn how do in my spare time as a hobby.  I've already scoped out a few places to acquire datasets (ex: data.gov) that i could practice with in the future.  Possibly, I could combine this with a website presentation, rather than a graphic.

    I like collecting and saving data.  Mostly just terabytes upon terabytes of linux isos.  I've taken to using a program called rclone and a sidekick program of it rclonebrowser(gui) to manage, upload, download data to (and between) cloud services.

3b)  I've set up a pi on my lan to manage torrents and act as a nas, instead of having my laptop tied down all the time.  i think this project is what really got me comfortable with linux.
